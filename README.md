## Features

- Based on [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) (the fastest math typesetting library on the web).
- Display expressions as an inline or a block element.
- Compatible with Markdown and BBCode.
- Copy any expression's source code to the clipboard.
- Integration with `flarum/mentions` extension so you can quote expressions with selection.
- Works on preview mode.

## Installation

```bash
composer require starsrivers/flarum-mathren
```

## Updating

```bash
composer update starsrivers/flarum-mathren
php flarum cache:clear
```

## Usage

Enable the extension.

#### Block Expressions

Wrap your TeX code with `[math]` and `[/math]` or your custom delimiters.

```
[math]\int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat\xi\,e^{2\pi i\xi x}\,d\xi[/math]
```

Block expressions will be wrapped with `.mathren-block` class.

#### Inline Expressions

Wrap your TeX code with `[imath]` and `[/imath]` or your custom delimiters.

```
Lorem ipsum dolor [imath]\varDelta = b^2-4ac[/imath] sit amet.
```

Inline expressions will be wrapped with `.mathren-inline` class.

#### Ignoring Expressions

If you're willing to show the TeX code with delimiters, there are three options:

1. Wrap your expression with \`backticks\` or `code` tag.
  + You must set it as an ignored tag from the settings page.
2. Wrap your expression with an ignored class.
  + You can set ignored classes from the settings page.
3. Use a decisive keyword with your expressions.
  + The keyword is `ignore` by default. But you can change it or assign multiple keywords from the settings page. You must write one of those keywords inside a BBCode (i.e. `[math=keyword]x^3[/math]`).

`.mathren-ignore` class will be added into ignored expression's wrapper by default. But you can change it from the settings page.
